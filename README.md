# COVID-19 Classifier CNN

This Repository comprises a deep learning (DL) classifier for X-Ray images. The classifier is based using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN is constructed using Tensorflow and Keras.

The DL model can be used to classify lung X-Ray images into three categories:
- COVID-19
- Viral Pneumonia
- Healthy Lung

The dataset that was used for training of the classifier can be accessed using the link below:
